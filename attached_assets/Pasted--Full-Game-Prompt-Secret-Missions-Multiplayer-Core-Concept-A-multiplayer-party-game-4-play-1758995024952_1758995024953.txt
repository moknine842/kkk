🎮 Full Game Prompt – Secret Missions Multiplayer
🎯 Core Concept

A multiplayer party game (4+ players) where each participant receives a secret mission.
The main objectives are:

Complete your mission without being discovered.

Identify other players’ missions to eliminate them.

The game is designed to work both in local mode (one device shared among players) and online lobbies (each player on their own device).

🏆 Objectives and Win Conditions
For Each Player

Primary Objective: Successfully complete your mission(s) before the timer runs out.

Secondary Objective: Correctly guess other players’ missions to eliminate them.

Elimination Rules

A player is eliminated if:

Another player correctly identifies their mission.

They accumulate three incorrect guesses while attempting to identify other players’ missions.

End of Game

If the global timer expires → all surviving players who have not been discovered win.

If only one player remains undiscovered → that player is declared the sole winner.

⏱ Time Management

Global Timer: Each round has a fixed duration to prevent endless sessions.

Optional Dynamic Timer: Missions must be completed within a certain time frame (e.g., 3 minutes) or the player loses one life/point.

🔀 Gameplay Variations and Options

Mandatory Clues: At fixed intervals (e.g., every 2 or 5 minutes), each player must reveal a clue related to their mission.

Multiple Missions: Some players may receive more than one mission simultaneously.

No-Mission Role: Some players may receive no mission at all → their objective is to confuse others and survive.

Shared Missions: Two players may receive the same mission, forcing them to collaborate secretly.

🎭 Mission Types

Missions can be categorized to balance difficulty:

Easy: Small, discreet actions (e.g., say a specific word, ask a basic question).

Medium: More visible actions (e.g., convince someone to swap seats, initiate a group vote).

Hard: Risky or creative challenges (e.g., make someone laugh without being noticed, slip in a coded phrase).

👉 Additional thematic mission packs (e.g., Horror, Comedy, Geek, Party) can be offered as optional DLC or premium content for replay value and monetization.

⚡ Special Powers (Optional Features)

Players may receive special cards or powers during the game, such as:

Switch → Swap your mission with another player.

Forced Question → Force a player to answer a direct question.

Silence → Cancel another player’s mandatory clue.

Betrayal → If in a shared mission, one player may betray their partner to gain a bonus.

🎮 Game Modes
1. Local Mode (One Device)

Each player secretly writes or inputs a mission.

The app randomly assigns missions to players.

Players pass the device around (screen lock or rotation to ensure secrecy).

2. Online Lobby Mode

Each player joins a private room with a code.

Missions are sent to each player’s personal device.

Communication: voice chat or a built-in mini text/emoji chat for hints and interaction.

🌟 User Experience Enhancements

Fun Interface: Custom avatars, humorous sound effects, simple design suitable for party settings.

Progression System: Titles and ranks (e.g., Master of Disguise, Top Detective, Stealth Champion).

Replayability: Every game is unique because missions are user-generated or randomized.

Social Hook: Perfect for streaming, TikTok clips, or game-night gatherings.

🎯 Final Objective of the Game

To create a unique social party game that combines:

The tension and deception of Among Us,

The creativity and unpredictability of charade-style games,

The replayability and fun of classic party games like Werewolf.

👉 This makes it highly marketable as the next-generation party game, playable both offline with friends and online with global players.
